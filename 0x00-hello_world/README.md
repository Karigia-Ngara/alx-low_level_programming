The different steps to form an executable file from C source code are:

Preprocessing: In this step, the preprocessor directives such as #include, #define, etc., are processed and replaced with actual code. This step generates a preprocessed source code file with an extension .i.

Compilation: In this step, the preprocessed source code is compiled into assembly code. The compiler checks the syntax and semantics of the code and generates an object file with an extension .o.

Assembly: In this step, the assembly code is converted into machine code or binary code using an assembler. This step generates an object file with an extension .o.

Linking: In this step, the object files generated in the compilation and assembly steps are linked together with the required libraries to create an executable file with no extension. The linker resolves the external references and generates the final executable file.
